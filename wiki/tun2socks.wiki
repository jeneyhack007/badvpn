#summary tun2socks - socksify TCP at the network layer

= Introduction =

`tun2socks` is used to "socksify" TCP connections at the network layer. It implements a TUN device which accepts all incoming TCP connections (regardless of destination IP), and forwards the connections through a SOCKS server. This allows you to forward *all* connections through SOCKS, without any need for application support. It can be used, for example, to forward connections through a remote SSH server.

= Example (tunelling through SSH) =

First create a TUN device:

  * On Linux, use `tunctl -u <someuser> -t tun0 -n` or `openvpn --mktun --dev tun0 --user <someuser>`.
  * On Windows, install OpenVPN (or, if you already have it, click the start menu shortcut that creates a new TAP-Win32 device).

Configure IP for the device, e.g. assign IP address 10.0.0.1, netmask 255.255.255.0.

Now start the program (on Linux, run it as `<someuser>`):
{{{
badvpn-tun2socks --tundev <tun_spec> --netif-ipaddr 10.0.0.2 --netif-netmask 255.255.255.0 --socks-server-addr 127.0.0.1:1080
}}}

where `<tun_spec>` is:

  * on Linux, `tun0`,
  * on Windows, `tap0901:<human_name_of_TAP_device>:10.0.0.1:10.0.0.0:255.255.255.0` (the three numbers are TUN interface IP address, network, and subnet mask.

NOTE: `--netif-ipaddr 10.0.0.2` is not a typo. It specifies the IP address of the virtual router inside the TUN device, and must be different than the IP of the interface.

Now you should be able to ping the virtual router's IP (`10.0.0.2`).

Connect to the SSH server, passing `-D localhost:1080` to the `ssh` command to enable dynamic forwarding. This will make `ssh` open a local SOCKS server which `badvpn-tun2socks` will use.
If you use Putty, go to Connection->SSH->Tunnels, type `1080` in `Source port`, choose `Dynamic` and click `Add`.

All that remains is to route connections through the TUN device instead of the existing default gateway. This is done as follows:

  # Add a route to the SSH server through your existing gateway, with a lower metric than the original default route.
  # Add default route through the virtual router in the TAP device, with a lower metric than the original default route, but higher than the SSH route.

This will make all external connections go through the TAP device, except for the SSH connection.

For example on Linux (assuming there are no existing default routes with metric <=6; if there are, remove them):

{{{
route add <IP_of_SSH_server> gw <IP_of_original_gateway> metric 5
route add default gw 10.0.0.2 metric 6
}}}
